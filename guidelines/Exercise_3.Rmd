## Exercise objectives

## Exercise data

## Guidelines

1. Load the file `"alepo.rds"`, which contains all the necessary data, and inspect the list elements until you understand them

```{r}

```

2. Estimate the leaf area index (LAI) and basal area of the forest stand at SNFI3 (year 2000) and at SNFI4 (year 2015).

```{r}

```

3. Build inputs for function `growth()` and perform a simulation for the historic period between SNFI3 and SNFI4

```{r}

```
