# 1. Forest and soil initialisation for large areas

---
## Data sources

The following is a list of data sources that I use for large-scale initialisation of `forest` and `soil` objects:

|  Data source    | Information | Spatial structure |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
|  DEM            | Topography  | Polygons/raster   |
|  Forest maps    | Forest composition (dominant species) | Polygons |
|  LiDAR data     | Vegetation height |  Raster |
|  National forest inventories | Composition and structure on point locations |  Points |
| SoilGrids | Soil texture, bulk density, organic matter,... | Raster |
| Shagguan et al. (2017) | Soil depth | Raster |

---
## Initialisation tips

The starting point of **medfate** models are `forest` objects, which require information about *structure* and *composition*. 

--

Initialisation of forests across a landscape/region requires imputation procedures are needed combining at least: (a) forest inventory data, (b) forest maps and (c) lidar data.

--

Most countries lack detailed soil maps and soil properties change substantially at small scales. 

--

Relying on SoilGrids implies accepting a high degree of uncertainly. Initialisation of soils requires at least combining SoilGrids with additional information on soil depth and rock content. 

--

Surface rock content can serve as a proxy of belowground rock content, but with a high degree of uncertainty!

# 2. Parameter estimation for multiple species

---

## Taxonomic treatment

Decide taxonomic treatment according to:

   1. Taxonomic resolution of forest data sources (e.g. forest inventory data)
   
   2. Availability of trait data

--

Store original source codes to be lumped into the same taxon/group (e.g. genus level)

--


Initialize medfate's *species* parameter table:

.code80[
.center[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
SpParams <-  medfateutils::initSpParams()
```
]
]

---

## Estimation from forest inventory data

Growth form (tree or shrub) depending on how the species is sampled in the forest source data:

  + Trees - Diameter, height,...
  + Shrub - Cover, mean height

--

The following information can be extracted from forest inventory data:

   + Maximum height
   + Diameter to height ratio
   + Growth rates
   + Mortality rates
   + Allometric relationships

---

## Sensitivity analyses and calibration

Sensitivity analyses and calibration procedures involve running many simulations with different parameter sets. If we build a matrix of parameter combinations, we can use function `multiple_runs()`, e.g.:
.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
multiple_runs(parMatrix, x1, examplemeteo, latitude = 42, elevation = 100,
              summary_function = sf)
```
]

--

Sensitivity analyses and calibration procedures require having functions that accept values of the parameters to be calibrated and return model outputs or evaluation metrics.

--

Package medfate includes *function factories*, i.e. functions that return functions to be used in model calibration or sensitivity analyses.

.font90[
| Function factory | Multiple cohorts | Function returns                    |
| ------------- | -------------------- |------------------------ |
| `optimization_function()` | No | The scalar of a simulation summary |
| `optimization_evaluation_function()` | No | The scalar of a simulation evaluation |
| `optimization_multicohort_function()` | Yes | The scalar of a simulation summary |
| `optimization_evaluation_multicohort_function()` | Yes | The scalar of a simulation summary |
]

---

## Sensitivity analyses and calibration

There is a package [vignette](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/articles/modelanalysis/SensitivityCalibration.html) illustrating the use of the former functions.

|  Analysis  | R package(s) |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Global sensitivity analysis |  **sensitivity** |
| Point calibration | **ga** (genetic algorithms), **stats** (gradient search) |
| Bayesian calibration | **BayesianTools** |

# 3. Spatial variation of climate forcing: meteoland

---

## Purpose

With the aim to assist research of climatic impacts on forests, **meteoland** provides utilities to estimate daily weather variables at any position over complex terrains:

1. Spatial interpolation of daily weather records from meteorological stations. 
2. Statistical correction of meteorological data series (e.g. from climate models).
3. Multisite and multivariate stochastic weather generation (underdeveloped).

--

## Installation

From **CRAN** (stable versions; now ver. **1.0.2**):

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("meteoland")
```
]

--

From **GitHub** (now ver. **`r packageVersion("meteoland")`**):
.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/meteoland")
```
]

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(meteoland)
```

---

## Spatial topography classes

Three classes are defined to represent the variation of topographic features (i.e., elevation, slope and aspect) over space, extending S4 classes of package **sp**:

+ Class **`SpatialPointsTopography`** extends `SpatialPointsDataFrame` and represents the topographic features of a set of points in a landscape.
+ Class **`SpatialGridTopography`** extends `SpatialGridDataFrame` and represents the continuous variation of topographic features over a full spatial grid.
+ Class **`SpatialPixelsTopography`** extends `SpatialPixelsDataFrame` and represents the continuous variation of topographic features over a set if cells in a grid.

--

.pull-left[
Data frames in topography classes have only three attributes:

  + `elevation` in meters a.s.l.
  + `slope` in degrees from the horizontal plane.
  + `aspect` in degrees from North.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig =TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
spplot(examplegridtopography, main = "Elevation (m)")
```

]

---

## Spatial meteorology classes

Analogously to topography classes, three spatial classes are used to represent the variation of daily meteorology over space, also extending classes in **sp**:

+ Class **`SpatialPointsMeteorology`** extends `SpatialPoints` and represents daily meteorology series for a set of points in a landscape.
+ Class **`SpatialGridMeteorology`** extends `SpatialGrid` and represents the continuous variation of daily meteorology across a grid of cells.
+ Class **`SpatialPixelsMeteorology`** extends `SpatialPixels` and represents the variation of daily meteorology for a set of pixels (cells) of a spatial grid.

--

.pull-left[
Spatial meteorology classes have two important slots: 

+ **`dates`** - a vector of days specifying a time period.
+ **`data`** - a vector of data frames with the meteorological data. 
  + One data frame for each point in `SpatialPointsMeteorology`. 
  + One data frame for each day in `SpatialGridMeteorology` and `SpatialPixelsMeteorology`. 
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig =TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ml = interpolationgrid(exampleinterpolationdata, examplegridtopography,
                       as.Date(c("2001-06-03")))
#Plot PET corresponding to 2001-06-03
plot(ml, main = "Mean temperature")
```
]

---

## Weather interpolation

### Interpolation methods

The general procedure for interpolation is very similar to the one that underpins the U.S. DAYMET dataset (https://daymet.ornl.gov/). 

--

+ *Minimum temperature*, *maximum temperature* and *precipitation* are interpolated from a set of point weather records using truncated Gaussian filters, while accounting for the relationship between these variables and elevation (Thornton et al. 1997). 

--

+ *Relative humidity* can be either interpolated (in fact, dew-point temperature is the variable being interpolated) or predicted from temperature estimates, depending on whether it was measured in in the set of reference points (surface stations). 

--

+ *Potential solar irradiance* is estimated taking into account latitude, seasonality, aspect and slope. Actual solar irradiance is then estimated from potential irradiance by including the effect of atmosphere transmittance using the predictions of temperature range, relative humidity and precipitation (Thornton & Running 1999).

--

+ The *wind vector* (wind direction and wind speed) is interpolated by using weather station records and static wind fields. 

---

## Weather interpolation

### MeteorologyInterpolationData

Package meteoland stores weather series for reference locations (surface weather stations) and interpolation parameters in a single object of class `MeteorologyInterpolationData`. 

Collecting and assembling surface weather records into an object of `MeteorologyInterpolationData` is the tedious part of using package **meteoland**.

--

### Interpolation functions

Interpolation is conducted using different R functions depending on the spatial input:

.font90[

|  Spatial input  |  Interpolation function  | Spatial output |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| `SpatialPointsTopography` | `interpolationpoints()` | `SpatialPointsMeteorology` |
| `SpatialGridTopography` | `interpolationgrid()` | `SpatialGridMeteorology` |
| `SpatialPixelsTopography` | `interpolationpixels()` | `SpatialPixelsMeteorology` |
]


---
## Downscaling and bias correction

### Concept

The general idea of correction is that a fine-scale weather series is compared to a coarse-scale series for a *reference* (historical) period. The result of this comparison can be used to correct coarse-scale weather series for a *target* (e.g. future) period.

--

### Correction methods

Let $x_i$ be the value of the variable of the more accurate (e.g. local) series for a given day $i$ and $u_i$ the corresponding value for the less accurate series (e.g., climate model output). 

Users can choose between three different types of corrections: 

  1. *Unbiasing*: consists in subtracting, from the series to be corrected, the average difference between the two series for the reference period: $\theta = \sum_{i}^{n}(u_i - x_i)/n$.
  
--
  
  2. *Scaling*: A slope is calculated by regressing $u$ on $x$ through the origin using data of the reference period. The slope can then be used as scaling factor to multiply the values of $u$ for any day of the period of interest.
  
--
  
  3. *Empirical quantile mapping*: Consists in comparing the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the two series for the reference period, and this mapping is used to correct values of $u$ for the target period.

---

## Downscaling and bias correction

### MeteorologyUncorrectedData

Statistical correction needs an object of class `MeteorologyUncorrectedData`, containing the coarse-scale data to be corrected (for both the reference and target periods) and the correction method to be used for each variable. e.g. 

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
u <- MeteorologyUncorrectedData(sp, u_reference, u_target, ...)
```
]

--

### Correction function

Correction is performed using function `correctionpoints()`, which takes as input the object of class `MeteorologyUncorrectedData` and an object of class `SpatialPointsMeteorology` with the fine-scale data for the reference period.

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
y <- correctionpoints(u, x)
```
]

The function will take all points in `x` as spatial target locations to perform the correction (and implicitly downscaling) of the coarse-scale data in `u`.

# 4. Simulation over landscapes: medfateland

---

## Purpose

The R package **medfateland** (under development) has been designed to run simulations of forest functioning and dynamics at the landscape and regional scales. 

--

The package allows executing the stand-level models available in package **medfate** on points and cells within landscape, in either sequential or parallel computation.

--

In addition, medfateland allows considering spatial hydrological processes in forested watersheds.

--
## Installation

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfateland")
```
]

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(medfateland)
```

---

## Data structures

Package **medfateland** offers three *spatial classes* that inherit fields from three corresponding classes in package **meteoland**:

* `SpatialPointsLandscape`: represents a set of forest stands (including soil description) as points within a landscape. Extends class `SpatialPointsTopography`.
* `SpatialPixelsLandscape`: represents a set of forests (including soil description) or other land cover units (i.e. agricultural, rock outcrops or urban areas) as pixels within a gridded landscape. Extends class `SpatialPixelsTopography`.
* `SpatialGridLandscape`: represents a set of forests (including soil description) or other land cover units (i.e. agricultural, rock outcrops or urban areas) as pixels within a complete grid. Extends class `SpatialGridTopography`.


--

An additional spatial class is defined for watershed ecohydrological modelling:

* `DistributedWatershed`: Represents a (forested) watershed, including land cover units (i.e. agricultural, rock outcrops or urban areas), forest and soil information as well as bedrock properties. Extends class `SpatialPixelsLandscape`.

---

## Data structures

.code80[
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=7}
data("examplepointslandscape")
```
]

--

Using `plot()` functions for spatial landscape objects, we can draw maps of some variables using:

.center[
.code80[
```{r, fig = TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=3}
plot(examplepointslandscape, "basalArea")
```
]
]

---

## Data structures


.code80[
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig = TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=3}
data("examplewatershed")
plot(examplewatershed, "elevation")
```
]

The set of maps available can be known by inspecting the help of function `getLandscapeLayer()`. Alternatively, the package provides function `shinyplotland()` to display maps interactively.


---

## Dynamic simulation functions


The package allows simulating water balance for multiple stands distributed spatially over a given time period using functions , `spwbpixels()` or `spwbgrid()`.

These functions make internal calls to `spwb()` on elements the spatial classes introduced above. 


.font80[
|  Spatial structure | Water balance (1 day) | Water balance (n days) | Forest growth | Forest dynamics |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
|  `SpatialPointsLandscape` | `spwbpoints_day()` | `spwbpoints()` | `growthpoints()` | `fordynpoints()` |
|  `SpatialPixelsLandscape` | `spwbpixels_day()` | `spwbpixels()` | `growthpixels()` | `fordynpixels()` |
|  `SpatialGridLandscape` | `spwbgrid_day()` | `spwbgrid()` | `growthgrid()` | `fordyngrid()` |
|  `DistributedWatershed` |  | `spwbland()` | `growthland()` |  |

]

---

## Climate forcing in large-scale simulations

Simulation functions of **medfateland** accept objects of class `MeteorologyInterpolationData` as input, which allows performing interpolation at the time of performing simulations.

--

The following workflow can be envisaged for large-scale simulations with **medfateland**:
