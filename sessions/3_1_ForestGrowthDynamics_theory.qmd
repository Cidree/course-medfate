# 1. Simulation models and processes

## About growth() and fordyn() models {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
1.  Simulation functions in **medfate** have been designed and implemented in a **nested** manner.
2.  The two water balance models (basic and advanced) are available for simulations with `growth()` and `fordyn()`.
3.  The `growth()` model implements several **daily** processes:
    i)  Carbon balance processes resulting from the interplay of sources (photosynthesis) and sinks (maintenance respiration, growth respiration, root exudation, etc.).
    ii) Growth and senescence processes that modulate changes in *leaf area*, *sapwood area* and *fine root area* of woody plant cohorts.
    iii) Structural changes (diameter and height for trees; cover and height for shrubs) derived from growth and senescence processes.
    iv) Tree mortality, which reduces cohort density.
4.  For applications spanning more than a few years, users will use the `growth()` model indirectly, via calls to `fordyn()`, which includes other processes implemented at **annual** steps:
    i)  Natural regeneration (recruitment)
    ii) The effect of disturbances (at present, only forest management and fire effects).

# 2. Carbon compartments, pools and carbon balance


## Carbon compartments and pools {.smaller}

**Carbon pool types**

*Structural carbon* - Cell membranes, cell walls & cytosolic machinery.

*Metabolic carbon* - Labile carbon (sugar) concentration used to sustain cell functioning.

*Storage carbon* - Labile carbon (starch) concentration used as long-term carbon source.

. . .

**Pools**

| Compartment | Structural | Metabolic | Storage |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| *Leaves* | Leaf dry biomass $B_{leaf}$ | Leaf sugar $SS_{leaf}$ | Leaf starch $ST_{leaf}$ |
| *Sapwood* | Sapwood dry biomass $B_{sapwood}$ | Sapwood sugar $SS_{sapwood}$ | Sapwood starch $ST_{sapwood}$ |
| *Fine roots* | Fine root dry biomass $B_{fineroot}$ |  |  |

## Labile carbon balance equations {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

A. Changes in **leaf metabolic** carbon result from considering gross photosynthesis ( $A_{g}$ ), leaf maintenance respiration ( $M_{leaf}$ ), phloem transport ( $F_{phloem}$ ) and sugar-starch dynamics ( $SC_{leaf}$ ) and translocation to sapwood storage ( $TS_{leaf}$ ):

$$\Delta{SS_{leaf}} \cdot V_{storage,leaf} = A_g - M_{leaf} - F_{phloem} - SC_{leaf} - TS_{leaf}$$

B. Changes in **leaf storage** carbon result from sugar-starch dynamics and translocation to sapwood storage ( $TT_{leaf}$ ):

$$\Delta{ST_{leaf}} \cdot V_{storage,leaf} = SC_{leaf} - TT_{leaf}$$

C. Changes in **stem metabolic** carbon result from considering phloem transport, maintenance respiration of sapwood ( $M_{sapwood}$ ) and fineroot ( $M_{fineroot}$ ) tissues, sugar-starch dynamics and translocation to sapwood storage ( $TS_{sapwood}$ ):

$$\Delta{SS_{sapwood}} \cdot V_{storage,sapwood} = F_{phloem} - M_{sapwood} - M_{fineroot} - SC_{sapwood}  - TS_{sapwood}$$

D. Changes in **stem storage** carbon result from considering sugar-starch dynamics, translocation from other pools, growth respiration and root exudation:

$$\Delta{ST_{sapwood}} \cdot V_{storage,sapwood} = SC_{sapwood} + TS_{leaf} + TT_{leaf} + TS_{sapwood} - G_{sapwood} - G_{leaf} - G_{fineroot} - RE_{sapwood}$$

## Design of labile carbon processes {.smaller}

-   **Phloem transport** is only explicitly modelled when using the **advanced water submodel**, following Hölttä et al. (2017)[^1].

-   **Sugar/starch dynamics** are meant to keep sugar levels at a prescribed equilibrium value.

-   The usual separation between **maintenance** and **growth** respiration is followed, with maintenance costs depending on temperature and phenology.

-   **Translocation** of labile carbon towards sapwood storage occurs whenever there is senescence in a given tissue (leaves, branches).

-   **Root exudation** is not a process competing for metabolic carbon, but a consequence of plant storage capacity being surpassed [^2].

## Tissue growth {.smaller}

Daily leaf area increment $\Delta LA$, sapwood area increment $\Delta SA$ and fine root biomass increment $\Delta B_{fineroot}$ are defined as the minimum of three constraints:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
$$\Delta LA = \min( \Delta LA_{alloc}, \Delta LA_{source}, \Delta LA_{sink})$$ $$\Delta SA = \min(\Delta SA_{source}, \Delta SA_{sink})$$ $$\Delta B_{fineroot} = \min( \Delta B_{fineroot,alloc}, \Delta B_{fineroot,source}, \Delta B_{fineroot,sink})$$
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   $\Delta LA_{alloc}$ and $\Delta B_{fineroot,alloc}$ are the increments allowed according to the targets set by **allocation rules**.
-   $\Delta LA_{source}$, $\Delta SA_{source}$ and $\Delta B_{fineroot,source}$ are the maximum increments allowed by current **starch availability**.
-   $\Delta LA_{sink}$, $\Delta SA_{sink}$ and $\Delta B_{fineroot,sink}$ are the increments expected due to **growth rates**, which are affected by temperature and turgor limitations [^3].
:::
:::::

[^3]: Lindner et al (1997). Forest Ecology and Management, 95, 183–195.

. . .

::: callout-important
-   Sapwood area growth is **not limited** by allocation rules, effectively determining overall plant growth.
-   Carbon is **preferentially** allocated to leaves and fine roots whenever storage levels are low because $\Delta SA_{source}$ is more restrictive than $\Delta LA_{source}$ or $\Delta B_{fineroot,source}$.

## Tissue senescence {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](resources/img/Allocation.drawio.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Leaf senescence rates** are determined by:
    -   *Aging* (leaf lifespan)
    -   *Phenology* (winter deciduous)
    -   *Dessication* (via stem cavitation)
-   **Sapwood senescence rates** are determined by:
    -   *Aging* (depending on temperature)
    -   *Sapwood area target* (only if $SA > SA_{target}$)
-   **Fine root senesence rates** are determined by:
    -   *Aging* (depending on temperature)
:::
:::::

. . .

::: callout-note
-   Leaf and fine root senescence create a need to constantly replace tissues.
-   Sapwood senescence aims to keep sapwood area close to its functional target (either constant leaf area to sapwood area ratio or a constant whole-plant conductance).

## Updating structural variables {.smaller}

**Trees**

New sapwood area, $\Delta SA$, is translated to an increment in DBH, $\Delta DBH$, following:

$$\Delta DBH = 2 \cdot \sqrt{(DBH/2)^2+({\Delta SA}/\pi)} - DBH$$

. . .

Increments in height are linearly related to increments in diameter through a coefficient depending on light conditions [^4], and are limited by a maximum height.

[^4]: Lindner et al (1997). Forest Ecology and Management, 95, 183–195.

. . .

Crown ratios are updated following static allometric relationships.

. . .

**Shrubs**

Leaf area changes are translated to changes in shrub volume, cover and shrub height via allometric equations.

. . .

As for trees, shrub height is limited to a maximum value.

# 4. Mortality and recruitment

## Plant mortality {.smaller}

1.  Small trees ( $1 < DBH < 7.5$ ) die at a rate determined by a **self-thinning rule** depending on its size.

. . .

2.  Species-specific parameters determine a daily constant **baseline mortality rate** for adults.

. . .

3.  Daily mortality rates increase due to **carbon starvation** whenever sapwood metabolic carbon, $SS_{sapwood}$, becomes lower than a threshold, set by default to 40% of the homeostatic (equilibrium) concentrations. The daily starvation rate at the threshold corresponds to an annual mortality of 50%.

. . .

```{r, fig = TRUE, fig.height=2.9, fig.width=10, echo = FALSE}
df_NSC <- data.frame(NSC_rel = seq(100, 0.0, by = -0.01))
df_NSC$Pstarvation = NA
for(i in 1:nrow(df_NSC)) {
  x <- (df_NSC$NSC_rel[i]/100 - 0.4)
  fact <- 40
  df_NSC$Pstarvation_annual[i] = 1 - exp(fact*x)/(1+exp(fact*x))
  df_NSC$Pstarvation_daily[i] = 1.0 - exp(log(1.0 - df_NSC$Pstarvation_annual[i])/356.0)
}

g1 <- ggplot(df_NSC)+
  geom_line(aes(x=NSC_rel, y = Pstarvation_annual), size = 1)+
  xlab("Percent of equilibrium starch concentration (%)")+ ylab("Annual starvation probability [0-1]")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 40, linetype = "dashed")+
  scale_x_reverse()+
  theme_bw()
g2 <- ggplot(df_NSC)+
  geom_line(aes(x=NSC_rel, y = Pstarvation_daily), size = 1)+
  xlab("Percent of equilibrium starch concentration (%)")+ ylab("Daily starvation probability [0-1]")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 40, linetype = "dashed")+
  scale_x_reverse()+
  theme_bw()
cowplot::plot_grid(g2, g1, nrow = 1)
```

. . .

4.  Daily mortality rates increase due to **dessication** whenever the average of *stem relative water content* and *stem relative hydraulic conductance* becomes lower than a pre-specified threshold, set to 40% by default.

::: footer
4.  Mortality and recruitment
:::

## Recruitment {.smaller}

Unlike mortality, recruitment is simulated *at the end of a simulated year* (only in `fordyn()`).

. . .

**Recruitment from seed**

-   **Seed banks** are full whenever trees of the species are present with a **size above a maturity threshold** (or a seed rain is forced). Otherwise, they are reduced following an exponential decay function.
-   The following conditions need to be met for a species to recruit:
    1.  **Mean temperature of the coldest month** is above a bioclimatic threshold.
    2.  The **fraction of light reaching the ground** is above a bioclimatic threshold.
    3.  The **moisture index** (annual precipitation over annual evapotranspiration) is larger than a bioclimatic threshold.
-   A **probability of recruitment** is used to stochastically determine whether recruitment actually occurs.

. . .

**Resprouting**

-   Resprouting occurs if plants have been **cut**, **burned** or **dessicated**.
-   Resprouting **survivorship** depends on the disturbance (different effects on buds).
-   Resprouting **vigour** for trees depends on $DBH$.

# 5. Biomass balance

## Biomass balance {.smaller}

**Balance in structural carbon pools**

The change in structural biomass of each **compartment** results from the interplay between growth and senescence:

$$\Delta{B_{leaves}} = B_{leaves, growth} - B_{leaves, senescence}$$ $$\Delta{B_{sapwood}} = B_{sapwood, growth} - B_{sapwood, senescence}$$ $$\Delta{B_{fineroot}} = B_{fineroot, growth} -  B_{fineroot, senescence}$$

. . .

The following equation defines the structural biomass balance at the plant level:

$$\Delta{B_{structure}} = \Delta{B_{leaves}} + \Delta{B_{sapwood}} +  \Delta{B_{fineroot}}$$

. . .

**Balance at the cohort level**

At the **cohort level** we need to take into account that some individuals will die, so that the biomass balance needs to incorporate mortality losses:

$$\Delta{B_{cohort}} = \Delta{B_{plant}} \cdot N_{cohort} - B_{mortality}$$

where $N_{cohort}$ is the initial cohort density (before mortality occurred) and $B_{mortality}$ is the biomass loss due to mortality of individuals, which in order to close the balance has to be defined as:

$$B_{mortality} = (B_{plant} + \Delta{B_{plant}}) \cdot N_{dead}$$

where $N_{dead}$ is the density of dead individuals and $B_{plant}$ is the initial plant biomass.
