# 1. Planned developments/improvements

---

## Model developments/research

+ Incorporate decomposition of litter and soil organic matter

+ Study the effect of root horizontal overlap on simulations

+ Implement fire effects on `fordyn()` simulations

+ Implement forest planning decisions (e.g. demand-based wood extraction) in *medfateland* simulation functions of forest dynamics

--

## Model application

+ Developing workflows/functions to facilitate the creation of `forest` objects from freely-available national forest inventories (e.g. France, US)

+ Developing species parameter tables for other countries/regions.

# 2. Your feedback on medfate and companion packages

---

1. Is *medfate* a suitable tool for your research/applied projects?

2. What, in your opinion, is the largest impediment to using the package?

3. What additional processes do you think could be easily implemented into *medfate* models?

4. Do you know of other data sources suitable for large-scale initialisation?
  
5. Do you know of other climate data sources suitable for *medfate* simulations?
  
6. Would you appreciate being given pre-defined initialisation data (e.g. for watersheds, IFN plots, etc.)?

# 3. Your feedback on the course

---

1. Was the course difficult to follow? Why?

2. Were the theoretical parts useful with respect to understanding the model? 

3. Were the exercises illustrative and useful?

4. What content do you think was missing and is key to understand/use *medfate*?
