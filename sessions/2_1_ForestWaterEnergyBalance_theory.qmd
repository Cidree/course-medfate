# 1. Preliminary concepts: hydraulics and drought effects

## Water potential {.smaller}

The water potential ($\Psi$) is the *potential energy of water*, relative to pure water under reference conditions. It quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another.

. . .

It has pressure units (e.g. MPa) and can be divided into different components:

![](resources/img/water_potential.svg){width="70%"}

. . .

But not all components are equally relevant in all contexts

1.  Preliminary concepts

## Soil water retention curves {.smaller}

The *water retention curve* of a soil (or *soil moisture characteristic curve*) is the relationship between volumetric soil moisture content ( $\theta$ in $m^3 \cdot m^{-3}$ of soil excluding rock fragments) and the corresponding soil water potential ( $\Psi$, in MPa)

. . .

Two water retention curve models are available in **medfate**:

. . .

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Saxton model**:

$$\theta(\Psi) = (\Psi/A)^{(1/B)}$$ where $A$ and $B$ depend on the texture and, if available, organic matter in the soil.

**Van Genuchten model**: $$\theta(\Psi) = \theta_{res}+\frac{\theta_{sat}-\theta_{res}}{\left[1+ (\alpha \cdot \Psi)^n \right]^{1-1/n}}$$ where $\theta(\psi)$ is the water retention, $\theta_{sat}$ is the saturated water content, $\theta_{res}$ is the residual water content, $\alpha$ is related to the inverse of the air entry pressure, and $n$ is a measure of the pore-size distribution.

```
:::

. . .

::: callout-important
Parameters of the water retention curves can be calibrated empirically but are normally derived from soil texture and bulk density.

## Plant pressure volume curves {.smaller}

The *pressure volume curve* of a plant tissue or organ is the relationship between relative water content ($RWC$, in $kg \, H_2O / kg \,  \, H_2O$ at saturation) and the corresponding water potential ( $\Psi$, in MPa).

. . .

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The relationship between $\Psi$ and $RWC$ is formulating by separating $\Psi$ into osmotic (solute) potential ($\Psi_{S}$) and the turgor pressure potential ($\Psi_{P}$):

$$\Psi = \Psi_{S} + \Psi_{P}$$
where
$$\Psi_{P} = -\pi_0 -\epsilon\cdot (1.0 - RWC)$$
and
$$ \Psi_{S} = \frac{-\pi_0}{RWC}$$ 

where $\pi_0$ (MPa) is the osmotic potential at full turgor (i.e. when $RWC = 1$) and $\epsilon$ is the modulus of elasticity (i.e. the slope of the relationship). 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
psi = seq(-10,0, by=0.1)
rwc_s = rep(NA, length(psi))
for(i in 1:length(psi)) rwc_s[i] =moisture_symplasticRWC(psi[i],-3,12)
tlp <- medfate::moisture_turgorLossPoint(-3,12)
df <- data.frame(psi = psi, rwc = rwc_s)
ggplot(df)+
  geom_line(aes(x=psi, y=rwc*100))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = tlp, linetype="dashed", col="gray")+
  scale_x_continuous("Water potential (MPa)")+
  scale_y_continuous("Relative water content (%)")+
  theme_bw()
```
:::
:::::

. . .

When $\Psi \leq \Psi_{tlp}$, the water potential at turgor loss point, then $\Psi_{P} = 0$ and $\Psi = \Psi_{S}$. If $\Psi > \Psi_{tlp}$ then the two components are needed.


## Hydraulic conductance and vulnerability curves {.smaller}

-   **Hydraulic conductance** $k$ measures how much flux exists along a pathway segment (e.g. soil, stem, leaves, ... ) for a given difference in water potential.

-   Hydraulic conductance decreases when **air replaces water** in any segment of the pathway.

-  The **vulnerability curve** specifies the relationship between water potential ($\Psi$) and hydraulic conductance ($k$) of a given segment.

. . .

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Rhizosphere**

Conductance is modelled as a van Genuchten (1980) function:

$$k(\Psi) = k_{max} \cdot v^{(n-1)/(2\cdot n)} \cdot ((1-v)^{(n-1)/n}-1)^2$$

![](resources/img/soil_vulnerability.png){width="60%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Xylem**

Conductance is modelled using a **Weibull** or a **Sigmoid**:

$$k(\Psi) = k_{max}\cdot e^{-((\Psi/d)^c)}$$

$$k(\Psi) = \frac{k_{max}}{1 + e^{(slope/25) \cdot (\Psi - \Psi_{50})}}$$ ![](resources/img/vulnerability_curves.png){width="60%"}

## Water potential drop in plants {.smaller}

When stomata are **closed** (e.g. during night), plant leaf water potential is assumed to be in *equilibrium* with the water potential in the rhizosphere (neglecting gravity effects).

. . .

When stomata are **open**, a larger transpiration flow ($E$) implies a larger *drop in water potential* along the transpiration pathway due to the negative pressure (suction) that arises [^1]:

## Drought impacts on plants {.smaller}

The decrease in soil water potential caused by drought has multiple effects on plants [^2], with some processes ceasing to occur and others becoming important or being promoted, depending on the plant response strategy [^3].

# 2. Forest water balance in `medfate` {background-color="#800033"}

## Water balance components {.smaller}

The water balance models in available in medfate simulate the following vertical water flows in a given forest stand.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="57%"}
![](resources/img/waterbalance.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="43%"}
| Component           | Symbol       | Description                             |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Infiltration        | $If$         | Water entering the soil from above      |
| Capillarity rise    | $Cr$         | Water entering the soil via capillarity from a lower saturated layer   |
| Deep drainage       | $Dd$         | Water percolating beyond the root zone |
| Saturation excess   | $Se$         | Excess of water in the soil             |
| Soil evaporation    | $Es$         | Evaporation from soil surface           |

| Herb transpiration  | $Tr_{herb}$  | Herbaceous plant transpiration          |

Variations in soil water content can be summarized as: $$\Delta{V_{soil}} = (If + Cr) - (Dd + Se + Es + Tr_{herb} + Tr_{woody})$$

## Soil water outputs {.smaller}

Regardless of precipitation, soil moisture can be modified due to the following processes:

![Sub-models involved in water outputs](resources/img/wb_outputs.png)

::: callout-important
Soil water uptake by plants, hydraulic redistribution and transpiration are modelled differently depending on the water balance model: **basic** vs **advanced**.
:::

::: footer
2.  Forest water balance in medfate
:::

## Soil water fluxes {.smaller}

Three submodels are available to simulate water movement *into*, *out of* and *within* the soil:

A. **Multi-bucket model**: Water inputs and drainage during a rainy day (and may be the next if over field capacity).

B. **Single-domain model**: Vertical water movement any day following gravitational and matric potentials (Richards equation). Assumes an homogeneous porous media.

C. **Dual permeability model**: Flows in the soil matrix following the previous model. Flows in the macropore domain following gravitational forces. The two domains exchange water.

![Sub-models of fluxes in the soil](resources/img/soil_flow_design.png){width="85%"}

. . .

::: callout-warning
The three sub-models differ greatly in computational demand (see Exercise 2b).

# 3. Transpiration and photosynthesis under the basic model {background-color="#800033"}

## Maximum canopy transpiration {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Maximum canopy transpiration $Tr_{\max}$ depends on potential evapotranspiration, $PET$, and the amount of transpirating surface, i.e. the stand leaf area index, thanks to an empirical relationship by Granier [^1]: 

$$\frac{Tr_{\max}}{PET}= -0.006\cdot (LAI^{\phi}_{stand})^2+0.134\cdot LAI^{\phi}_{stand}$$

[^1]: Granier et al. (1999). Ecol. Model., 116, 269-283.

and therefore:

$$Tr_{\max} = PET \cdot \left( -0.006\cdot (LAI^{\phi}_{stand})^2+0.134\cdot LAI^{\phi}_{stand} \right)$$
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](resources/img/granier_model.png){width="80%"}

:::::

Maximum canopy transpiration is divided among plant cohorts according to the amount of light absorbed by each one.

::: callout-note
Granier's equation is actually species-specific in **medfate**.

## Actual plant transpiration {.smaller}

Actual plant transpiration depends on soil moisture and is calculated for each soil layer $s$ separately.

. . .

::::: columns
::: {.column width="\"50%"}
A *relative whole-plant water conductance*, $k_{rel}$ is defined for any given soil layer $s$ using:

$$k_{rel}(\Psi_s) = \exp \left \{\ln{(0.5)}\cdot \left[ \frac{\Psi_{s}}{\Psi_{extract}}\right] ^r \right \}$$

where $\Psi_{extract}$ is the water potential at which transpiration is 50% of maximum, and $\Psi_s$, the water potential in layer $s$.

. . .

The water extracted by a plant cohort from soil layer $s$ and transpired, $Tr_{s}$, is the product:

$$Tr_{s} =  Tr_{\max} \cdot k_{rel}(\Psi_{s}) \cdot FRP_{s}$$ where $FRP_{s}$ is the proportion of plant fine roots in layer $s$.

. . .

::: callout-important
This transpiration model allows emulating stomatal closure in response to soil water deficit but do not allow modelling stomatal responses to other factors.
:::

::: footer
3.  Transpiration and photosynthesis under the basic model
:::

## Plant photosynthesis {.smaller}

Gross photosynthesis for a plant cohort, $A_g$, is estimated as a function of transpiration, $Tr$, using:

$$A_{g} = Tr \cdot WUE_{\max} \cdot (L^{PAR})^{WUE_{PAR}} \cdot (1 - e^{WUE_{CO2} \cdot C_{air}}) \cdot VPD^{WUE_{VPD}} $$

where:

-   $WUE_{\max}$ is the maximum water use efficiency of the cohort under maximum light availability, $VPD = 1kPa$ and no $CO_2$ limitations.
-   $L^{PAR}$ is the proportion of photosynthetically active radiation available and $WUE_{PAR}$ is an exponent.
-   $C_{air}$ is the air $CO_2$ concentration and $WUE_{CO2}$ is a regulating coefficient.
-   $VPD$ is vapour pressure deficit and $WUE_{VPD}$ is a regulating coefficient.

. . .

::: callout-note
Parameters regulating photosynthesis cannot be related to traits. The estimation of these parameters and those regulating transpiration is done via a [metamodelling exercise](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/articles/parametrization/Metamodelling.html).
:::

::: footer
3.  Transpiration and photosynthesis under the basic model
:::

## Plant water potential {.smaller}

The basic water balance model **does not** estimate the water potential drop from soil to the leaf.

. . .

Despite its simplicity, a gross surrogate of **'plant' water potential**, $\Psi_{plant}$, may be obtained using:

$$\Psi_{plant}= k_{rel}^{-1} \cdot \left(\sum_{s}{k_{rel}(\Psi_s)\cdot FRP_{s}}\right)$$

which can be intuitively understood as an *average of soil water potential* taking into account fine root distribution.

## Advanced features {.smaller}

-   The advanced transpiration and photosynthesis model operates at **sub-daily** time steps.

## Sperry sub-model: Supply function {.smaller}

The supply function describes the **steady-state** rate of water flow, $E$, as a function of water potential drop.

. . .

The steady-state flow rate $E_i$ through any element $i$ is related to the flow-induced drop in water potential across that element, $\Delta \Psi_i  = \Psi_{down} - \Psi_{up}$, by the integral of the vulnerability curve $k_i(\Psi)$ [^7]:

[^7]: Sperry et al. (1998) Plant, Cell & Environment, 21, 347â359.

$$E_i = \int_{\Psi_{up}}^{\Psi_{down}}{k_i(\Psi) d\Psi}$$

where $\Psi_{up}$ and $\Psi_{down}$ are the upstream and downstream water potential values.

. . .

::::: columns

**1. Cost function**

The hydraulic supply function is used to derive a **cost function** $\theta(\Psi_{leaf})$, reflecting the increasing damage from cavitation.

$$\theta(\Psi_{leaf}) = \frac{k_{c,max}-k_{c}(\Psi_{leaf})}{k_{c,max}-k_{crit}}$$

where $k_c(\Psi_{leaf}) = dE/d\Psi(\Psi)$ is the slope of the (whole-plant) supply function.

:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**2. Gain function**

The normalized photosynthetic **gain function** $\beta(\Psi_{leaf})$ reflects the increase in assimilation rate, with respect to the maximum.

$$\beta(\Psi_{leaf}) = \frac{A(\Psi_{leaf})}{A_{max}}$$

where $A_{max}$ is the instantaneous maximum (gross) assimilation rate estimated over the full $\Psi_{leaf}$ range.

**3. Profit function**

Stomatal regulation can be effectively estimated by determining the maximum of the *profit function*: $$Profit(\Psi_{leaf}) = \beta(\Psi_{leaf})-\theta(\Psi_{leaf})$$

![](resources/img/profitfunction.png){width="80%"}

The maximization is achieved when the slopes of the gain and cost functions are equal: $$\frac{\delta \beta(\Psi_{leaf})}{\delta \Psi_{leaf}} = \frac{\delta \theta(\Psi_{leaf})}{\delta \Psi_{leaf}}$$

## Sureau sub-model {.smaller}

SurEauâs sub-model, leaf energy balance, stomatal and cuticular conductances, transpirational flows, photosynthesis and plant hydraulics are computed **iteratively** in small temporal sub-steps (e.g. 10 min).

. . .

**Plant hydraulics**

Water dynamics in SurEau-ECOS [^8] are governed by **partial differential equations** of mass conservation:

[^8]: Ruffault et al. (2022) Geosci. Mod. Dev., 15, 5593-5626

$$C_i \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}\Psi_i}{\mathrm{d}t} + \sum_{j}{k_{ij}\cdot (\Psi_i - \Psi_j)} - S = 0$$

where $\Psi_i$ and $\Psi_j$ are the water potential of compartments $i$ and $j$, respectively, $C_i$ is the **capacitance** associated to the compartment $i$ and $S$ is an outflow component (e.g. stomatal transpiration, cuticular transpiration or cavitation flux).

. . .

**Stomatal regulation**

Stomatal conductance takes into account the dependence of stomata on light and temperature [^9], as well as leaf water status:

[^9]: Baldocchi D. (1994) Tree Phys., 14, 1069-1079

$$g_{sw} = g_{sw, light, temp} \cdot \lambda(\Psi_{leaf,sym}) $$

where $g_{sw, light, temp}$ is the stomatal conductance value without water stress, and $\lambda$ is a regulation factor that represents stomatal closure according to leaf water potential, using a sigmoid function.

. . .

**Cuticular conductance**

Cuticular conductances are not only species-specific but also change with leaf temperature, according to changes in permeability of lipids in the epidermis.

Since the derivative of the supply function, i.e. $dE / d\Psi_{leaf}$, is the *absolute* whole-plant conductance:
