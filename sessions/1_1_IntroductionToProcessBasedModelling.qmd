# 1. Fundamental concepts

## Models: What are they?

-   *Model* - A simplification of reality constructed to gain insights into a set of attributes of a physical, biological, economic, or social system.
-   *Conceptual model* - A **hypothesis** regarding the important factors that govern the behavior of an object or a process of interest.
-   *Statistical model* - A numerical model **built using observations** within a probabilistic framework.
-   *Mechanistic (or process-based) model* - A numerical model that explicitly **represents the understanding** of physical, chemical or biological processes.
-   *Simulation model* - A numerical model that represents the development of a solution by incremental steps through the model domain.

## Model components

-   *Modules* or *sub-models* - An independent or self-contained component of a model.
-   *State variables* - The dependent variables calculated within a model, which often **change over the simulation**.
-   *Parameters* - Terms in the model that are **fixed during a model run** but can be changed in different runs.
-   *Constants* - Terms that are **fixed values under all runs**, representing known physical, biological or ecological activities (e.g. the speed of light).

## Model assessment

-   *Verification* - Examination of the implementation to ascertain that they truly represents the conceptual model and there are no inherent numerical problems.
-   *Qualitative assessment* - Uncertainty in model predictions that **cannot be quantified** (i.e. about the theory underlying the model or the model design).
-   *Uncertainty analysis* - Investigation of the effects of lack of knowledge or potential errors of inputs (e.g. climate forcing) on the model output.
-   *Robustness* - The capacity of a model to perform well **across the full range of conditions** for which it was designed.
-   *Sensitivity* - The degree to which the model outputs are **affected by changes in input parameters**.
-   *Transparency* - The clarity and completeness with which data, assumptions, and methods of analysis are **documented**.

# 2. Modelling cycle

## Modelling tasks: Development

1.  *Problem formulation*

    -   Definition of objectives
    -   Definition of the spatio-temporal physical domain

2.  *Model design and formulation*

    -   Data availability
    -   Use of existing vs. new model
    -   Conceptual model
    -   Use of existing modules

3.  *Implementation*

    -   Algorithmic design
    -   Model coding (e.g. C++)
    -   Profiling and code optimization

## Modelling tasks: Development

4.  *Parameterization and calibration*

    -   Sources for direct parameter estimation
    -   Sources for parameter calibration
    -   Meta-modelling

5.  *Model analysis*

    -   Verification and qualitative assessment
    -   Sensitivity/uncertainty analysis
    -   Formal evaluation (validation)

6.  *Model application*

    -   Simulation and documentation
    -   Quantifying uncertainty
    -   Evidence for decision
