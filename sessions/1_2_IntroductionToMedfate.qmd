# 1. Purpose and development context {background-color="#D4AA00"}

## Model scope

-   Being able to anticipate the impact of global change on forest ecosystems is one of the major environmental challenges in contemporary societies.

-   The set of R packages conforming the **medfate modelling framework** have been designed to study the characteristics and simulate the functioning and dynamics of forest ecosystems.

-   Climatic conditions are the main environmental drivers, with a particular focus on drought impacts under Mediterranean conditions.

-   Representation of vegetation accounts for structural and compositional variation but is not spatially-explicit (i.e. trees or shrubs do not have explicit coordinates within forest stands).

## Development context {.smaller}

**Funding**

I have been intensively working on medfate since 2013, when I obtained a Ramon y Cajal research fellowship from the Spanish government. Four other research projects (FORESTCAST, DRESS, BOMFORES, IMPROMED) have funded further developments.

Developments were also supported by CTFC (until March 2021) and CREAF, where I currently coordinate its *Ecosystem Modelling Facility*.

. . .

**Contribution**

A large number of people has contributed with *ideas*, *data* or *code* to the project:

Jordi Martínez-Vilalta (CREAF-UAB, Spain), Maurizio Mencuccini (ICREA, Spain), Juli G. Pausas (CIDE-CSIC, Spain), Pilar Llorens (CSIC, Spain), Rafa Poyatos (CREAF, Spain), Lluís Brotons (CREAF-CSIC, Spain), Antoine Cabon (WSL, Switzerland), Roberto Molowny (EMF-CREAF, Spain), Victor Granda (EMF-CREAF, Spain), Adriana Tovar (EMF-CREAF, Spain) Alicia Forner (MNCN-CSIC, Spain), Lluís Coll (UdL, Spain), Pere Casals (CTFC, Spain), Mario Beltrán (CTFC, Spain), Aitor Améztegui (UdL, Spain), Nicolas Martin-StPaul (INRA, France), Shengli Huang (USDA, USA), Enric Batllori (UB-CREAF, Spain), Santi Sabaté (UB-CREAF, Spain), Daniel Nadal-Sala (UB, Spain), María González (UPV, Spain), Núria Aquilué (CTFC, Spain), Mario Morales (UniZar, Spain), Léa Veuillen (INRAE, France), ...

. . .

**Institutions**

The framework is the joint effort of different institutions:

## Package suite

During the development of **medfate** ancillary functions were originally included in the package itself...

. . .

... but many of them were later moved into more specialized packages:

# 3. Package installation and documentation {background-color="#D4AA00"}

## Installation

In this course, we will use packages **meteoland**, **medfate**, **medfateland**, which are installed from CRAN (stable versions):

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("meteoland")
install.packages("medfate")
install.packages("medfateland")
```

. . .

More frequent updates can be obtained if installing from **GitHub**:

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/meteoland")
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfate")
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfateland")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(meteoland)
library(medfate)
library(medfateland)
```

## Documentation

A [reference book](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/) is available for detailed formulation of processes.

. . .

Several vignettes are available at the web pages of [medfate](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/) and [medfateland](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/), including:

a. How to create model inputs
b. How to perform simulations
c. Parameter estimation procedures
d. Evaluation benchmarks
e. Estimated computational times

. . .

This course can be found at the [training](https://emf.creaf.cat/training/) section of the *Ecosystem Modelling Facility* website.

## Simulation functions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Three main simulation models can be executed in **medfate**:

| Function   | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `spwb()`   | Water and energy balance                                     |
| `growth()` | Carbon balance, growth and mortality                         |
| `fordyn()` | Forest dynamics, including recruitment and forest management |

## Plot/summary functions

Functions are included to *extract*, *summarise* and *display* the time series included in the output of each simulation function:

| Function      | Description                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `extract()`   | Reshapes daily or subdaily output into data frames. |
| `summary()`   | Temporal summaries of results.                      |
| `plot()`      | Display time series of the results.                 |
| `shinyplot()` | Interactive exploration of results.                 |

## Sub-model functions

A large number of functions implement sub-models (i.e. modules) on which the simulation functions are built.

. . .

They are included in the package, as **internal** (they are not visible in function index).

. . .

Sub-model functions are grouped by *subject*:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
| Group          | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|

| `carbon_*`     | Carbon balance                 |
| `fuel_*`       | Fuel properties                |
| `fire_*`       | Fire behaviour                 |
| `hydraulics_*` | Plant hydraulics               |
| `hydrology_*`  | Canopy and soil hydrology      |
| `light_*`      | Light extinction and absortion |
| `moisture_*`   | Live tissue moisture           |
