# 1. Purpose and development context


---

## Model scope

Being able to anticipate the impact of global change on forest ecosystems is one of the major environmental challenges in contemporary societies.

--

The set of R packages conforming the **medfate modelling framework** have been designed to study the characteristics and simulate the functioning and dynamics of forest ecosystems.

--

Climatic conditions are the main environmental drivers, with a particular focus on drought impacts under Mediterranean conditions.

--

Representation of vegetation accounts for structural and compositional variation but is not spatially-explicit (i.e. trees or shrubs do not have explicit coordinates within forest stands).

---

## Development context

I have been intensively working on medfate since 2013, when I obtained a Ramon y Cajal research fellowship from the Spanish government. Four other research projects (FORESTCAST, DRESS, BOMFORES, IMPROMED) have funded further developments.

--

Developments were also supported by CTFC (until March 2021) and CREAF, where I currently coordinate its *Ecosystem Modelling Facility*.

--

A large number of people has contributed with *ideas*, *data* or *code* to the project:

# 2. Set of R packages

During the development of **medfate** ancillary functions were originally included in the package itself...

--

.. but many of them were later moved into more specialized packages:

# 3. Package installation and documentation

## Installation

In this course, we will use packages **meteoland**, **medfate**, **medfateland**, which are installed from CRAN (stable versions):

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("meteoland")
install.packages("medfate")
install.packages("medfateland")
```
]

--

More frequent updates can be obtained if installing from **GitHub**:

.code80[
```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/meteoland")
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfate")
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfateland")
```
]


.code80[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(meteoland)
library(medfate)
library(medfateland)
```
]

--

## Documentation

Several vignettes, describing creation of model inputs and how to perform simulations, are available at the web pages of  [medfate](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/) and [medfateland](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/).

--

A more complete and detailed documentation of the models included in the package, including formulation and parameterization, can be found in the [medfatebook](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/index.html).

## Simulation functions

.pull-left[

Three main simulation models can be executed in medfate:
.font90[

|  Function | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `spwb()` | Water and energy balance    |
| `growth()` | Carbon balance, growth and mortality |
| `fordyn()` | Forest dynamics, including recruitment and forest management |

]
]
.pull.right[
<img class="packages" src="resources/img/Package_design_medfate.png" width=350>
]

---

## Plot/summary functions

Functions are included to *extract*, *summarise* and *display* the time series included in the output of each simulation function:

.font90[
|  Function | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `extract()` | Reshapes daily or subdaily output into data frames.  |
| `summary()` | Temporal summaries of results.  |
| `plot()` | Display time series of the results.  |
| `shinyplot()` | Interactive exploration of results.  |
]

--

## Post-processing functions

Some package functions are meant to be used on simulation results (some of them implementing static ancillary models) and produce time series of additional properties.

.font90[
|  Function | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| `droughtStress()` | Plant drought stress indices    |
| `waterUseEfficiency()` | Water use efficiency metrics    |
| `resistances()` | Hydraulic resistances to water transport    |
| `fireHazard()` | Potential fire behaviour   |
]

---

## Sub-model functions

A large number of functions implement sub-models (i.e. modules) on which the simulation functions are built. 

--

They are included in the package, as **internal** (they are not visible in function index).

--

Sub-model functions are grouped by *subject*:

.pull-left[
.font90[
|  Group    | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
|  `biophysics_*` | Physics and biophysics |
|  `carbon_*` | Carbon balance |
|  `fuel_*`  | Fuel properties |
|  `fire_*`  | Fire behaviour |
|  `hydraulics_*` | Plant hydraulics |
|  `hydrology_*` | Canopy and soil hydrology |
|  `light_*` | Light extinction and absortion |
|  `moisture_*` | Live tissue moisture  |
]
]

--

.pull-right[
.font90[
|  Group    | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
|  `pheno_*` | Leaf phenology  |
|  `photo_*` | Leaf photosynthesis  |
|  `root_*` | Root distribution and conductance calculations  |
|  `soil_*` | Soil hydraulics and thermodynamics  |
|  `transp_*` | Stomatal regulation, transpiration and photosynthesis  |
|  `wind_*` | Canopy turbulence |
]
]
