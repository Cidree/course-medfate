## Water balance input object

## Simulation input object

Simulation functions `spwb()` and `growth()` (and similar functions) require first combining forest, soil, species-parameter and simulation control inputs into a single input object (of class `spwbInput` or `growthInput`) that is then used as input to the corresponding simulation function along with weather data.
