## Introduction

This repository contains a course devoted to use simulation models in
**medfate** and **medfateland** packages. The course is presented as a
set of Quarto markdown (`*.qmd`) files, which can be easily deployed
into html format.

Course sessions are updated to the most recent course edition and
package versions.

## Usage

The course slides are made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). This
publishing system should be installed in order to modify the
presentation.
